## preamble
The author is mainly developing c++ and python on remote linux server using local win11 platform. Thus this note would be directly helpful for those developer who work same way as me.
1. Why win11 rather than linux?
    - Gaming or other enjoyment shoule also be part of daily(or maybe weekly or whatever longer but necessary) requirement.
    - There are actually lots of helpful applications such as xshell/xterm or MobaXTerm.
    - Windows Terminal and Powershell could be really powerful.
    - WSL(windows subsystem for linux) could actually satisfy maybe most of your local needs. (As it would be one the remote linux server where you actually develop your project.)
2. Remote developing IDE?
    - VSCode. Somehow a traditional way for remote developing? You could still use it.
    - JetBrains Gateway. If you are familier with PyCharm or CLion or other JetBrains' IDE, I would strongly recommand this to you.

## Step By Step
1. Window terminal
    If you are using Windows professional, Windows Terminal should be already installed with system. 
    
    Otherwise, just open windows store and search Windows Terminal and install.

    Or you could install by yourself according to [https://github.com/microsoft/terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).
